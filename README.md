# TwitchChatSharp

Making Twitch chat a bit easier to use for .NET developers. See MinimalisticExample for an example on how to use.

Available via NuGet `Install-Package TwitchChatSharp`.

# Unmaintained

Should still work, but lacks some of the newer functionality and even bug fixes are not guaranteed. Consider using https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib instead.
